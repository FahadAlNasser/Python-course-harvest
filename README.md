# Python-course-harvest
This is also one of the assignments that I completed for my python class, which is that harvesting course numbers from my university website by using the library's requests and re. I included the list of course numbers that I harvested from my university website. I wrote the code to make the course appear once and eliminate any other words that I have harvested. This was challenging for me to complete where I recall that I experienced many erros that I received writing this code with regular expression and lambda where I could not include course numbers and names. I struggled with removing any other aspects that I have harvested from the website. Although, I have managed to make my code work eventually as you can see on the file.
You notice that this code was created by Jupyter Notebook. This is a alternative web to write a code on their platform for python https://jupyter.org. 
In class we were allowed to use either Google Colab or Jupyter, although, it is perferable for the assigments to be completed on jupyter where it is helpful to create projects.
